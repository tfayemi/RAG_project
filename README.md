# RAG Project: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Pipeline

Welcome to the **RAG Project** – an end-to-end pipeline that demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This project combines document retrieval using vector stores with state-of-the-art language models to generate informed and context-rich responses.

## Overview

The RAG Project is designed to showcase a pipeline where documents are first indexed into a vector database, and then a fine-tuned language model leverages the retrieved context to generate answers to user queries. The pipeline is built with a focus on efficiency, modularity, and scalability.

Key components include:

- **Document Processing:** Load and filter articles from a directory.
- **Vector Store Indexing:** Create an index for quick and accurate retrieval of relevant documents.
- **Retriever & Query Engine:** Retrieve contextually similar documents based on user queries.
- **Fine-Tuned LLM:** Generate responses using a fine-tuned language model with retrieval-augmented context.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Clear separation of concerns with functions for document loading, indexing, retrieval, and response generation.
- **Efficient Document Filtering:** Streamlined filtering using list comprehensions to remove unwanted content.
- **Advanced Retrieval:** Utilizes a similarity-based retrieval mechanism with a configurable cutoff.
- **State-of-the-Art LLM Integration:** Seamlessly integrates a fine-tuned language model (via PEFT) to generate responses.
- **Scalable Pipeline:** Designed to handle growing datasets and complex queries.
